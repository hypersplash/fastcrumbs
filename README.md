# What’s this even for?

Sure, you could open your system calculator or punch some numbers into Google…  
but where’s the style in that?

Here’s what Fastcrumbs is perfect for:

- ⚡ **Quick Math, Anywhere** – Great for devs, students, or anyone too lazy to open a full app.  
- 💻 **Dashboard Integration** – Embed it on internal tools, Raspberry Pi setups, or local dashboards.  
- 🧮 **Minimalist Bliss** – Because math deserves to look this clean.
